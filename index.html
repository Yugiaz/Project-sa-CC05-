      <h2> For my Bebiii </h2>
      <p>
        Hi Bebiiii, happy monthsary saating dalawaaaa, i love you soooo much my bebi, alam mo ba na i still feel like i'm dreaming when i think of us and how we are now. Having such a wonderful woman in my life has changed a lot of things about me, and those changes are the best part of me meeting you. You've literally turned my world upside down (yes that song) you've show me that there's better things in life, and that there's more to life than just being the man i used to be. You're the one woman i believe in with all of my heart, and my love for you only grows with each passing day, and my heart belongs to you as much as yours belongs to mine. I love the way things are now that i met you, i get to see all the better parts of my life, with you i feel like the sky's the limit, and with you i feel loved and cared for. Bebi, our relationship has only made us stronger not just as a couple, but also as an individual. I love you so much Bebi, even when at times you think the world may be cruel to you, please know that i always got your back. You're the most beautiful woman in my eyes, and nothing will ever change that fact, you're the best part of my life and i hope that you always keep that not only in your mind but in your heart. I love you so much Bebiiii, i want our relationship not to only grow but also mature, loving you made me love myself more and that will always be true. I hope to reach more milestones like this and when that time comes, i want you to walk down that aisle. I love you so much Bebiiii, here's to a longer and more happier moments to come with the love of my life, I love you more, always, and foreverrrrr!!
